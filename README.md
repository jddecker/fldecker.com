FLDecker.com is a website containing information, photos, and artwork for my dad, FL Decker, who passed away June 27, 2020.

Some of what I'm still working on is:
- [ ] Deciding on which photos to feature on the website
- [ ] Compiling different artwork to display
- [ ] Working on a header image
- [x] Contact page setup with email address
- [x] Navigation page created
- [x] 404 page setup
- [x] Links page setup with some links to informaton elsewhere on the web
