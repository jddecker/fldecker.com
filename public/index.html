                    <p><strong>Frederick L. (FL) Decker</strong></p>
                    <p>November 18, 1943 - June 27, 2020</p>
                    <p>Frederick Lee (FL) Decker, 76, passed away on June 27th from Alzheimer's.</p>
                    <p>Rick was born on November 18, 1943, to Glen and Louise (Erickson) Decker in Seattle, WA.</p>
                    <p>An accomplished painter, sculptor, and stained-glass maker, Rick spent most of his life in Skagit Valley, mainly in Blanchard, where he lived and maintained an art studio. His work has been collected throughout the Western US and Canada. Rick exhibited extensively including at Whatcom Museum, Corning Museum of Glass, Sierra Arts Foundation, and Seattle Art Museum.</p>
                    <p>When not creating art, summers were spent working in the Alaskan salmon canning industry where he retired as a foreman.</p>
                    <p>He is survived by wife Dena Decker, son Jeffrey Decker, several cousins, and friends.</p>
                    <p>At this time memorial services will be held privately for immediate family. Those wishing to honor his life can make a donation in his name to the <a href="https://www.alz.org/alzwa">Alzheimer's Association</a>. Pictures, artwork, and additional information will be available later at FLDecker.com.</p>

                    <h3>Words from his cousin Melinda Lamp</h3>
                    <p>Rick was born into a fishing family, the men in the family either fished or worked in the canneries in Alaska. In his early years Rick traveled to Alaska in the summer months where his parents, Glen and Louise, worked. Winters the family stayed on Fir Island, Skagit County, with his Erickson grandparents. Trips were made by steamships north, airplanes back. When it was time for school the family settled in Seattle.</p>
                    <p>An Ingraham High School graduate, art was his calling and summers working in Alaska paid the bills. He attended art school in San Francisco, returned to the NW living first on Guemes Island and then settling in Blanchard. As F.L. Decker, Rick made an impression in the NW art community participating in art shows, museum presentations and supporting charity art auctions.</p>
                    <p>Rick's art changed over the decades, but his glasswork, especially windows using vintage glass, were his specialty. He had a true feeling for design, a solid approach to structure and found great satisfaction when a project was completed in the vision he had when he began. Rick had a fondness for the fish that he spent summers with and he has many art projects incorporating fish. Family and friends treasure his and Dena's annual holiday cards......decades of fish as the theme, every year different.</p>
